# TestinMAUIPageNavigationPerf

Here is the base code for a simple testing project.

The aim is to trouble shoot here the MAUI navigation errors I encounter in my main, other, projects.

Here my first issue is that going to and from a second Page using built in MAUI Shell navigation end up to crash after X times of going back and forth.

The issue is more detailled in my SO post here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79010614/maui-shell-navigation-crash-randomly-windows

Here is a video to my issue for reference : https://youtu.be/EalCE11MG60
